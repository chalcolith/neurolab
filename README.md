========

Neurocognitive Linguistics Lab ("NeuroLab" for short) is a program for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux that allows you to experiment with relational networks using a convenient GUI, and record the results of your experiments in tabular form.

Neurocognitive Linguistics is an approach to linguistics developed by Sydney Lamb which uses relational networks to model what the brain actually does when it handles language.

Features
--------

- Create relational network diagrams using Sydney Lamb's Abstract Notation, using AND and OR nodes with bidirectional links; or the low-level Narrow Notation using nodes, oscillators, and excitory and inhibitory links.
- Simulate spreading activation in the network.
- Collect and save data from your simulations in CSV format.
- Written in C++ using the cross-platform Qt Framework, and the Qt Creator IDE.
- Network simulation is implemented using a parallel asynchronous network automaton, which uses all available processor cores for maximum speed.
- Implement new types of relational network entities using the convenient plugin system.
