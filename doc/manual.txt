Neurocognitive Linguistics is an approach to linguistics developed by
http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~lamb[Sydney Lamb] which uses relational
networks to model what the brain actually does when it handles
language. You can read more about it at the
http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~lngbrain/main.htm[LangBrain] web site and the
http://www.glottopedia.de/index.php/Neurocognitive_linguistics[Glottopedia] wiki.
