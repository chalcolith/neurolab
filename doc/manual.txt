Introduction
------------

Neurocognitive Linguistics is an approach to linguistics developed by http://www.ruf.rice.edu/%7Elamb[Sydney Lamb] which uses relational networks to model what the brain actually does when it handles language. You can read more about it at the http://www.ruf.rice.edu/%7Elngbrain/main.htm[LangBrain] web site and the http://www.glottopedia.de/index.php/Neurocognitive_linguistics[Glottopedia] wiki.

Neurocognitive Linguistics Lab (``NeuroLab'' for short) is a program that allows you to experiment with relational networks using a convenient GUI, and record the results of your experiments in tabular form.

Getting Started
---------------

You can find this manual, as well as other information, at the http://bitbucket.org/kulibali/neurocogling/wiki/Home[NeuroLab website].

Download and Install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The latest distribution of NeuroLab is at the http://bitbucket.org/kulibali/neurocogling/downloads[Download Page].  NeuroLab is available for Windows XP/Vista/7, Mac OS X, and Linux.

Windows
^^^^^^^

The Windows distribution comes in two forms, a ZIP file and a Windows Installer MSI file.  To run NeuroLab from the ZIP file, download it, then right-click it in Windows Explorer and choose "Extract All" from the context menu.  This will create a new folder containing the executable program +NeuroLab.exe+, along with a +samples+ directory that contains several sample files.  If you choose to use the MSI file, simply download and run it.  This will install the program to +C:\Program Files+ (or wherever else you choose to install it) and create a Start Menu entry for it.  The sample files can be located in +C:\Program Files\NeuroLab\samples+.

Mac OS X
^^^^^^^^

The OS X distribution is a DMG disk image file, which, when you download it, should open to reveal the NeuroLab application, which you can drag to your Applications folder, if you like, or run directly from the mounted DMG.  A +samples+ folder containing several sample files is included in the DMG.

Linux
^^^^^

The Linux distribution is a tarball.  Download and extract it.  The resulting directory contains a script called +neurolab+ that launches the application, as well as a +samples+ folder containing several sample files.
