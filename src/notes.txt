Some implementation notes:

  Several scenarios:
  
    - interactive drawing mode, where we place nodes and test them
    - cortex mode, where we have an auto-generated grid, and we can interactively test with input/output sequencers
    - mt training mode, where we have an auto-grid, but we automatically train with parallel corpora -- can test with cortex mode
  
  Some UI elements
  
    Params: 
      time between sequence items
      lifetime to keep sequence items activated
      
    Step, run
    
    Sequencers:
      - one kind for dragging interactive nodes to, then can activate them in sequence
      - one kind for characters -- 256 of them, for utf-8 input
    

  Data
    grid of neural elements - nodes and links are both nodes in the graph
